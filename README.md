A fun little project to aid me in learning C#

A way for me to control streams over twitch.tv via my old generation 1 Novation Launchpad

Eventually my aim is to be able to control my LIFX strip, manage OBS scenes and transitions and possibly a soundbank via the launchpad.

Makes use of https://github.com/isaacrlevin/LifxCloudClient
and a modified version of https://github.com/iUltimateLP/launchpad-dot-net
